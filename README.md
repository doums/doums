### NAME
       Pierre Dommerc - code writer.

### SYNOPSIS
       **pierre**

### DESCRIPTION
       Hi, I'm **Pierre**. I am passionate about code. At the
       moment, I'm mainly interested in Rust :crab:. And I like to
       develop my own tools with it since 2018. I enjoy keeping my
       foot in system programming. And yes I'm used to doing C
       sometimes.

       I'm a big fan of Linux and the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) (**Do One
       Thing And Do It Well.**). I am convinced that people should
       be the sovereign of their machine and their data. I'm
       concerned about my privacy and the respect of my human
       rights in the digital world.

       At work I exchange my time against web development to earn
       money in the startup bulldustry. I mainly work with stuff
       like TypeScript, GraphQL (in code first only), gRPC, AWS,
       Docker and about the front part I'm on the side of
       React/Native.
